goals

-- organize file system to allow new machines   
    - move config files to dedicated folder
    - move value generating files to folder
    - keep drivers/machines higher up

-- eliminate templates file

-- the_machine -> blend save modes
    - create multiple grid sizes of same color
    - save in 'blend' folder

-- create the repeater
    - choose generation method
    - "pixelate" fractals based on average values
        - overlay different grid sizes
        - each layer
        
    - generation modes
        - traditional: no bound, linear
        - attractors:  bounded, trig
        - dynamical system: time is indepentent

Responsibilities
-- the_repeater
    request tile information from IFS generator
        default or trig
        multiple IFS on one canvas

    generate tile svgs 
    save into folder
    decide coloring?

-- how to start
    get average values for NxM grids displayed in grayscale
    change threshold of shading
